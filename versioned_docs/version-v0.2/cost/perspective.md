## Create a Perspective

1. Click on `Cost Management` -> `Perspectives` in the navigation bar to get to the perspective list.
2. Click on `Create Perspective`, enter a `Name` to identify your custom perspective. This name should be unique so that you can easily find your perspective.
3. Define the cost units you want to track in the perspective. You can select the range of consumption data by `Time Range` and `Cost Source`, and choose the tracking items by `Group By` and `Granularity`.
4. Define the cost-sharing rules. These rules determine how common costs are allocated to different items in the cost unit. You can select the range of shared data by `Shared Cost Source`, configure whether idle costs should be added to the shared costs by `Allocate Cluster Idle Costs`, manage whether costs should be added to the shared costs by `Allocate Cluster Management Costs`, and finally, select the corresponding `Allocation Method`.
5. Click `Save` to save your custom perspective and configuration. You can now use this custom perspective to track and manage your costs.
